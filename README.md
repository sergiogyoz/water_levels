# TS class
The watlevpy package is meant for filtering and preprocessing daily-measured water level data for modeling applications. It currently includes two modules devoted to plotting raw data and one for statistical analysis.

# future  projects
-I hope to incorporate automated retrival of data using CUAHSI library to extract from USGS
-Include as many tools for stationarity assessment as possible 
-Maybe use pandas as a base for the class array objects instead of just numpy arrays... (it depends on how many functionalities I could end up using from it)
-Create a report class to generate an overall report on stationarity
