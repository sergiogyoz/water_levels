<h1>watlevpy </h1>
  <h2>current status </h2>
    <p>Watlevpy package is meant for filtering and preprocessing daily-measured water level data for modeling applications. It currently includes four modules devoted to reading, filtering, plotting raw data and one for statistical analysis. I'm about to add a couple of working examples illustrating how to use it but right now there's a lot of uncommented code and only one Jupyter notebook basic tutorial.
    </p>

<h2> future  projects </h2>
  <ul>
    <li>I will incorporate automated retrival of data using CUAHSI library to extract from USGS</li>
    <li>Include as many tools for stationarity assessment as possible</li>
    <li>Maybe use pandas as a base for the class array objects instead of just numpy arrays... (it depends on how many functionalities I could end up using from it)
</li>
    <li>Create a report class to generate an overall report on stationarity
</li>
  </ul>
