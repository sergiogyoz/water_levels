# WaterLevels class
The water level package is meant for filtering and preprocessing daily-measured water level data for modeling applications. It currently includes two modules devoted to plotting raw data and one for statistical analysis.

# future  projects
I hope to incorporate other frequencies to the WaterLevels class for higher (instant) and lower (yearly) frequency data and its corresponding statistical modeling.
