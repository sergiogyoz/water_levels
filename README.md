<h2> TS class </h2>
<p>The watlevpy package is meant for filtering and preprocessing daily-measured water level data for modeling applications. It currently includes two modules devoted to plotting raw data and one for statistical analysis.

<h2>future  projects</h2>
<ul>
  <li>I will incorporate automated retrival of data using CUAHSI library to extract from USGS in a user friendly way (code stat dictionary from USGS)</li>
  <li>Include as many tools for stationarity assessment as possible</li>
  <li>Maybe use pandas as a base for the class array objects instead of just numpy arrays... (it depends on how many functionalities I could end up using from it) </li>
  <li>Create a report class to generate an overall report on stationarity
</li>
</ul>
